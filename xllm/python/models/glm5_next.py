"""glm5_next (model_type=glm5_next) causal LM — Python model executor target.

Hybrid decoder: 3 of every 4 layers are KDA (Kimi Delta Attention) linear
attention; the 4th is MLA full-attention driven by a DSA ``kPool`` sparse
indexer. MLP is dense SwiGLU for the first ``first_k_dense_replace`` layers and
DeepSeek-V2-style MoE (sigmoid + noaux_tc) thereafter. bf16 throughout, matching
the patched HuggingFace ``Glm5NextForCausalLM`` reference for tensor alignment.

This is a faithful pure-torch port of the transformers implementation
(``transformers/src/transformers/models/glm5_next/modeling_glm5_next.py``) so
that per-tensor alignment against the reference is exact (same ops, same fp32
cast points, same eps, same interleaved RoPE, same scatter-based mask).

KDA goes through the stable ``fused_recurrent_kda`` /
``chunk_kda`` interfaces (same signatures as the transformers
``@use_kernel_func_from_hub``-decorated functions). Today those run the faithful
pure-torch delta-rule bodies (matching transformers' recurrent/chunk paths for
alignment); an NPU small-kernel implementation can later be swapped in behind
the same interface without touching the layer. No fla_npu dependency.

Per-layer linear state (conv_state + recurrent_state) is managed by the
framework: the executor binds per-sequence ``(conv_cache, ssm_cache)`` slots
onto each KDA layer and the layer reads/advances/writes them via the
``linear_state_indices`` / ``has_initial_state`` metadata view, giving correct
multi-sequence batch and cross-step decode. When no metadata/slots are
available (standalone align path) every call is treated as a fresh full
prefill.

v1 runs purely on torch/torch_npu with no xllm_ops / paged backend, so
the model is alignable standalone. Framework-layer / ops / TP / paged-cache
integration is a follow-up. The mHC (multi-residual-stream) hyper-connection
residual is implemented and always on, matching the patched transformers
reference (the ``mhc`` config field is not consulted by the reference forward).
